# Implementation Plan - XGrid Campers Ambassador Map

## Overview
This document outlines a phased implementation approach for deploying the XGrid Campers Ambassador Map application. Each phase builds upon the previous one, with comprehensive testing requirements before proceeding to the next phase.

## Architecture Considerations

### Supabase RLS (Row Level Security)
Since Supabase tables have RLS enabled, we need to implement one of these strategies:
1. **Service Role Key (Server-side only)** - Use for read-only operations in API routes
2. **Public Anon Key + RLS Policies** - Configure RLS policies for public read access
3. **JWT Authentication** - Implement if user-specific data access is needed

For this application, we'll use:
- **Service Role Key** in Next.js API routes for write operations (cases table)
- **Anon Key with RLS policies** for public read operations (ambassadors, camper_models)

### AWS Amplify Deployment
- Environment variables will be configured in AWS Amplify Console
- Build settings will be defined in `amplify.yml`
- Custom domain will be configured post-deployment
